### About our project:
Get a new perspective on your DND or other tabletop RPG campaigns with DnDiaries!

Input your characters with the bookmark icon and then record your adventures with the inkpot.

You will then see all your epic moments come to life as DALLE-3 reimagines your edventure and puts it in image form.

DnDiaries keeps track of all your adventures so you can always look back and reminisce on the good times!

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: API calls cost $0.04 an image so I would ask that the judges to not do mass testing. It would be preferable if you didn't do more than 20 API calls (generating an image)
